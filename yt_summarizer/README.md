# additional requirements:
we must install the ffmpeg application, which is one of the requirements for the yt_dlp package. This application is installed on Google Colab instances by default. The following commands show the installation process on Mac and Ubuntu operating systems.
```
# MacOS (requires https://brew.sh/)
#brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu
#sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
